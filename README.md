### Dream Team

Plan and execute development projects across three execution tiers:
sequential, delegated sub-agents, and full agent teams.

Dream Team separates your workflow into three phases — brainstorm,
spec, build — each with dedicated commands and clean handoffs.
It ships with specialized agents (builder, researcher, architect,
reviewer, tester, validator, debugger) that can be orchestrated in
single-session, delegated, or full parallel team configurations.

```text
/plugin install dream-team@dream-team-marketplace
```
